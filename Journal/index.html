        <h2>8/21</h2>

        <p>I had never considered the idea that technology was the central focus of most main stream science fiction. I suppose it does make sense, but it does limit us all in many ways. It makes sense when referring to human-centered science fiction, because our end goal of innovation has revolved around available technology for centuries. But when considering extra terrestrial science fiction, it is funny to assume that non-human life has the same goal. I guess that&#39s one reason why I&#39ve always been fond of very specific moments in Star Wars like Luke on Tatooine gazing out at the dual sunset. In moments like those, or when the Ewok are celebrating the end of Empire Strikes Back, technology is not the focus; You&#39re just seeing life. </p>

        <p>I very much resinated with this piece. I remember being a kid and searching the early versions of the internet as we know it. Websites, at the time, felt so personal and so handmade. There wasn&#39t really a standard to follow, so most companies, or creators kind of just made what felt like them; There was a very personal quality. Now, when you look at a website, especially for a major organization or company, it&#39s almost overstimulating. So much information, yet so little character. It definitely makes you miss the handmade days. </p>

        <h2>9/11</h2>

        <p>The idea that the web used to be more personal, creative, and even weird feels strangely refreshing, especially compared to how polished and algorithm-driven everything is now. I liked the reminder that you don&#39t need fancy tools or a big audience to make something meaningful online. You can just build a small page that reflects who you are.</p>

        <p>I despised this. It was scary.</p>

      <h2>10/9</h2>

      <p>I liked the comparison to the original back-to-the-land movement, because it made the idea of a small, self-sufficient internet feel more real and possible. It also made me notice how dependent I am on big platforms without even questioning it. The idea of creating smaller, slower, more intentional online spaces feels refreshing, almost like taking a deep breath after being stuck in the noise of social media. It made me curious about what my own digital homestead could look like if I wasn&#39t trying to fit into the mainstream web.</p>

      <h2>10/30</h2>

    <p>I liked the way Chimero compared the internet to the reading room in a library. it made me realize how rarely the web feels peaceful or generous anymore. Most online spaces are designed to grab my attention, not give me room to breathe. The essay made me want to be more intentional about the digital spaces I choose to spend time in and maybe even create some that feel more good room than noisy marketplace. It was a nice reminder that the internet doesn&#39t have to feel chaotic; it can feel human if we make it that way.</p>
